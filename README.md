# Aura — a multimodal mental wellness coach

**Gemma 3n · voice, text and images in · text and speech out**

Aura listens the way a good coach does. You can type, talk, or show it something.
It reads tone as well as words, notices the themes you keep circling back to, and
replies with reflection and one open question — not a checklist. When someone
describes real danger, it stops coaching and puts a human being in front of them.

## Run it in 60 seconds
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arnavdsp/Gemma-3n-Hackathon.git
cd Gemma-3n-Hackathon
git checkout claude/wellness-coach-multimodal-gj4r65
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
aura serve
```
Open http://localhost:8000. That's the whole setup.

You get the real UI, the real API, streaming, image attachments, the affect estimator, the topic graph and the crisis screening — all of it. What's different is the engine behind it: a reflective-listening coach built from the same principles as the system prompt (mirror the person's words, name the feeling tentatively, ask one open question). It has structure but no world knowledge. Good for demoing the product and developing against; it won't hold a genuinely intelligent conversation.

That works on any laptop with no GPU, no model download and no API key, because
the base install ships a **reflective-listening fallback engine** (see
[Engines](#engines)). 

To run the real thing:

```bash
pip install -e '.[ml]'          # torch + transformers
AURA_ENGINE=gemma aura serve     # downloads unsloth/gemma-3n-E2B-it on first run
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build       # http://localhost:8000
```

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Listens in three modalities** | Type, record your voice, or share an image. Gemma 3n takes all three natively through one chat template — no bolted-on captioner or separate ASR service. |
| **Reads tone, not just words** | A lexicon estimator over the transcript, optionally fused with a wav2vec2 prosody classifier. When the words say "I'm fine" and the voice doesn't, the coach is told about the gap. |
| **Speaks back** | SpeechT5 (or Piper) synthesises the reply. Markdown is stripped first so it doesn't read asterisks aloud. |
| **Remembers the shape of the conversation** | A stack of turns plus a topic **co-occurrence graph**, so it can tell you that sleep keeps coming up alongside work — with no extra model calls. |
| **Screens for crisis before generating** | A conservative lexical screen runs *first*. On a crisis match, generation is skipped entirely and real helplines are returned. It cannot be talked around, because the model never gets the turn. |
| **Streams** | Server-sent events, so replies appear as they're written. |

### The interface

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/welcome.png" width="60%" alt="Aura's opening screen" />
</p>

Designed to be quiet: muted sage and warm paper rather than saturated brand
colour, one accent used sparingly, generous line height, and motion that honours
`prefers-reduced-motion`. A tool that competes for your attention works against
its own purpose.

- **Voice** with a live waveform, so you can see it's hearing you
- **Drag, drop or paste** an image anywhere on the page
- **Session insights** — mood sparkline, direction, and the topic graph
- **Full keyboard access**, visible focus rings, `aria-live` on the transcript
- **Light and dark**, following the system or your explicit choice
- **WCAG AA contrast**, verified programmatically rather than by eye
- Works down to a 390 px phone

## Architecture

```
Browser (vanilla ES modules, no build step)
  │  SSE  ·  multipart uploads
  ▼
FastAPI  ── routes: /api/chat · /api/chat/stream · /api/uploads · /api/sessions
  ▼
Coach (aura/coach.py) — orchestrates one turn:
  1. resolve attachments   → asr.py (Gemma native, Whisper fallback), vision.py
  2. screen for risk       → safety.py          ← runs BEFORE generation
  3. estimate affect       → affect.py          (text ⊕ prosody)
  4. build the prompt      → prompts.py + memory.py (topic graph, mood trend)
  5. generate              → engine/gemma.py | engine/echo.py
  6. synthesise speech     → tts.py             (best-effort; never blocks the reply)
  ▼
SessionStore — in-memory, TTL'd, LRU-bounded. Nothing touches disk.
```

Each module is independently testable and has no import-time dependency on
torch, which is why the suite runs in three seconds on a CPU.

## Engines

`AURA_ENGINE` selects the backend:

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `auto` *(default)* | Gemma 3n when `torch`/`transformers` are importable, otherwise `echo`. |
| `gemma` | Require Gemma 3n. Fails loudly if the ML stack is missing. |
| `echo` | The fallback engine, always. |

**The echo engine is not a stub.** It is a small reflective-listening coach built
from the same principles as the system prompt: mirror the speaker's own words,
name the feeling tentatively, ask one open question. It has no world knowledge —
only structure. It exists so that the UI, the API contract, CI and demos are
exercised for real on any machine, and so a GPU outage degrades the product
instead of ending it. Its output is deterministic per input.

---

## Safety

This is a wellness coach, not a clinician, and the code says so everywhere.

- The screen runs **before** generation. On a crisis match the model is never
  invoked, so no amount of prompting can route around it.
- It **fails toward escalation**, and softens `CRISIS` to `ELEVATED` when the
  language indicates a past or third-party account ("I used to…", "my friend
  said…") — so someone recounting their recovery isn't hit with an interrupt.
- Helplines are region-aware (`AURA_CRISIS_REGION`: `US`, `IN`, `UK`, `INTL`) and
  always include an international fallback.
- The crisis reply still **acknowledges the person** before it lists numbers.
- Conversations live in memory only, expire on a TTL, and are never written to
  disk or used for training. `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}` erases one immediately.

21 of the 119 tests cover this module alone, including false-positive cases
("I'm going to *kill* this presentation") and the softening rules.

## Training

The notebooks in `notebooks/` are preserved as the original exploration. The
pipeline they sketch is reimplemented, and debugged, in `src/aura/training/`.

```bash
pip install -e '.[train]'                       # GPU required
aura dataset --out artifacts/data --show 1      # inspect the pairs first
aura train --strategy dpo --max-steps 200
aura evaluate --engine gemma --adapter artifacts/wellness-coach/adapter
```

Then serve the adapter:

```bash
AURA_ADAPTER_PATH=artifacts/wellness-coach/adapter AURA_ENGINE=gemma aura serve
```

**Why DPO.** The thing being taught — reflective over directive, curious over
dismissive — is a *preference between two plausible replies*, not a single
correct string. Pairs are drawn from `jkhedri/psychology-dataset` (its own
preferred/dispreferred columns) and `drublackberry/hbr-coaching-real-leaders`
(real coach turns as `chosen`). SFT on the `chosen` side is available via
`--strategy sft` for environments where DPO's reference model doesn't fit.

<details>
<summary><strong>Three bugs in the original notebook, and their fixes</strong></summary>

1. **The datasets were concatenated with `+`**, which `datasets.Dataset` doesn't
   support — and the psychology set uses `question`/`response_j`/`response_k`,
   not `prompt`/`chosen`/`rejected`, so the validation pass would have discarded
   every row regardless. Now mapped explicitly, with a per-reason drop tally.
2. **The rejected coaching reply spliced in the user's own first word**
   (`f"You should just {client_text.lower().split()[0]} differently"`), which
   teaches the model that rejected replies begin with the user's words rather
   than that they are directive. Replaced with generic directive responses that
   carry no content from the prompt.
3. **Training failures were swallowed by a bare `except`** that silently fell
   through to a second trainer, so a misconfigured run looked like a successful
   one. The fallback is now explicit (`--fallback-to-sft`) and logs the
   traceback first.

Also added: deduplication, length filtering, a held-out eval split, and bf16/fp16
selected from the hardware rather than hard-coded to fp16.
</details>

### Evaluating behaviour, not just loss

A loss curve says nothing about whether a wellness coach got *better*.
`aura evaluate` scores held-out prompts on the qualities the fine-tune is meant
to instil — asks a question, avoids directives, reflects, hedges, stays brief,
avoids diagnosis — plus a **pass/fail safety check** that CI enforces on every
push.

```
Mean coaching score: 72.2%
Safety: PASS

Per-criterion pass rate:
  asks_question        100.0%  ████████████████████
  avoids_directives    100.0%  ████████████████████
  reflects              33.3%  ███████
  hedges                16.7%  ███
  concise              100.0%  ████████████████████
  avoids_diagnosis     100.0%  ████████████████████
```

These are lexical proxies for catching regressions between checkpoints, not
ground truth. Only the safety check is treated as pass/fail.

## API

Interactive docs at `/api/docs` once the server is running.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/chat` | One buffered turn |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/stream` | The same turn as SSE (`meta` → `token`* → `done`) |
| `POST` | `/api/uploads` | Stage an image or audio clip, returns an id |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/{id}` | Transcript plus derived insights |
| `DELETE` | `/api/sessions/{id}` | Erase a conversation |
| `GET` | `/api/resources` | Crisis resources for a region |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Engine state and live capability flags |

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"I have been feeling overwhelmed at work lately"}'
```

---

## Development

```bash
make dev        # install with dev tooling
make test       # 119 tests, ~3s, no GPU or network
make lint       # ruff
make evaluate   # behavioural scoring
make serve      # hot reload
```

CI runs the suite on Python 3.10–3.12, lints, builds the Docker image and smoke
tests the running container.

### Deploy to Vercel + WebGPU (Real Gemma in-browser, $0 cloud GPU cost)

Vercel hosts Aura's frontend, and modern browsers run **Gemma 2B directly on the user's GPU via WebGPU** (powered by WebLLM). This means:
- **Real Gemma AI coaching** on Vercel without requiring cloud GPU servers.
- **100% client-side privacy**: Voice and text reflections remain on the device.
- **Zero server costs**: Vercel serves the static assets; inference is executed client-side.
- **Automatic fallback**: If a browser lacks WebGPU support, Aura gracefully falls back to the serverless API.

```bash
# One-time: link the project
vercel link

# Deploy
vercel deploy --prod
```

Vercel can host Aura as a single Python serverless function. Because the function
is short-lived and stateless, only the **echo engine** is supported on Vercel —
Gemma 3n needs a long-lived GPU host (Modal, RunPod, or a Vast.ai box). The
public website works; sessions and uploaded media reset on every cold start.

```bash
# One-time: link the project
vercel link

# Deploy (Vercel runs ``pip install -e .`` per vercel.json)
vercel deploy --prod
```

What the deploy does:

- `api/index.py` wraps the FastAPI app with Mangum, the ASGI → serverless
  adapter. Vercel invokes the `handler` for every request.
- `vercel.json` rewrites everything (`/`, `/api/chat`, `/assets/...`) to
  `/api/index`, so a single function handles both the UI and the API.
- `public/` holds a copy of `index.html`, `styles.css` and `app.js`. FastAPI's
  `StaticFiles` mount serves them, so the same code path runs locally and on
  Vercel.
- `.vercelignore` keeps the deployment package small: no `src/`, no `tests/`,
  no notebooks, no Docker files.

To switch static-file paths when developing locally, leave `AURA_STATIC_DIR`
unset (it defaults to `web/`). On Vercel, `api/index.py` sets it to `public/`
before importing the app.

**Vercel limitations to be aware of:**

| | |
|---|---|
| Function timeout | 30s on the hobby plan. The echo engine responds in milliseconds. |
| Cold start | ~1-2s. The first request after inactivity will be slow. |
| Memory | 1024 MB by default. More than enough for the echo engine. |
| Sessions | In-memory. Each cold start wipes them — by design, since this is a wellness product. |
| No ffmpeg | WebM/Opus uploads will not decode on Vercel. Plain WAV works. |
| Static assets | Served by FastAPI inside the function, not from Vercel's CDN. Fine for a demo, slow for production. |

### Configuration

Every setting is an `AURA_*` environment variable — see [`.env.example`](.env.example)
for the annotated list. The ones that matter most:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AURA_ENGINE` | `auto` | `auto` · `gemma` · `echo` |
| `AURA_MODEL_ID` | `unsloth/gemma-3n-E2B-it` | `E4B` for the larger variant |
| `AURA_ADAPTER_PATH` | — | LoRA adapter from `aura train` |
| `AURA_CRISIS_REGION` | `INTL` | `US` · `IN` · `UK` · `INTL` |
| `AURA_TTS_BACKEND` | `speecht5` | `speecht5` · `piper` · `none` |
| `AURA_ASR_BACKEND` | `gemma` | `gemma` · `whisper` · `none` |
| `AURA_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` | `21600` | 6 hours |
| `AURA_STATIC_DIR` | `web/` | Set to `public/` on Vercel (set automatically in `api/index.py`) |

### Known limits

- Sessions are in-process, so the service is single-node as written. `SessionStore`
  is deliberately narrow (`get`/`create`/`delete`) so Redis can replace it.
- On Vercel, the function is short-lived. Each cold start wipes session state
  and uploaded attachments — acceptable for a privacy-first wellness product,
  not for long-running coaching relationships.
- The affect lexicon is English-only. Gemma 3n itself is multilingual; the tone
  estimate is not.
- Prosody-based emotion is off by default — it needs an extra wav2vec2 model and
  adds noticeable latency.
- Browser audio arrives as WebM/Opus; decoding it needs `ffmpeg` on the host
  (included in the Docker image, but **not** in Vercel functions). Plain WAV
  uploads work everywhere.
