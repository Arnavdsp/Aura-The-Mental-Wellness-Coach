# Aura — a multimodal mental wellness coach

**Gemma 3n · voice, text and images in · text and speech out**

**[Try it live](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ADP123456/aura-wellness-coach)** — real Gemma 3n E4B on a ZeroGPU Space.

Aura listens the way a good coach does. You can type, talk, or show it something.
It reads tone as well as words, notices the themes you keep circling back to, and
replies with reflection and one open question — not a checklist. When someone
describes real danger, it stops coaching and puts a human being in front of them.

## Run it in 60 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnavdsp/Gemma-3n-Hackathon.git
cd Gemma-3n-Hackathon
pip install -e .
aura serve
```

```bash Open <http://localhost:8000>.```

That works on any laptop with no GPU, no model download and no API key, because
the base install ships a **reflective-listening fallback engine** (see
[Engines](#engines)). To run the real thing:

```bash
pip install -e '.[ml]'          # torch + transformers
AURA_ENGINE=gemma aura serve     # downloads unsloth/gemma-3n-E2B-it on first run
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build       # http://localhost:8000
```

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Listens in three modalities** | Type, record your voice, or share an image. Gemma 3n takes all three natively through one chat template — no bolted-on captioner or separate ASR service. |
| **Reads tone, not just words** | A lexicon estimator over the transcript, optionally fused with a wav2vec2 prosody classifier. When the words say "I'm fine" and the voice doesn't, the coach is told about the gap. |
| **Speaks back** | SpeechT5 (or Piper) synthesises the reply. Markdown is stripped first so it doesn't read asterisks aloud. |
| **Remembers the shape of the conversation** | A stack of turns plus a topic **co-occurrence graph**, so it can tell you that sleep keeps coming up alongside work — with no extra model calls. |
| **Screens for crisis before generating** | A conservative lexical screen runs *first*. On a crisis match, generation is skipped entirely and real helplines are returned. It cannot be talked around, because the model never gets the turn. |
| **Streams** | Server-sent events, so replies appear as they're written. |

### The interface

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/welcome.png" width="60%" alt="Aura's opening screen" />
</p>

Designed to be quiet: muted sage and warm paper rather than saturated brand
colour, one accent used sparingly, generous line height, and motion that honours
`prefers-reduced-motion`. A tool that competes for your attention works against
its own purpose.

- **Voice** with a live waveform, so you can see it's hearing you
- **Drag, drop or paste** an image anywhere on the page
- **Session insights** — mood sparkline, direction, and the topic graph
- **Full keyboard access**, visible focus rings, `aria-live` on the transcript
- **Light and dark**, following the system or your explicit choice
- **WCAG AA contrast**, verified programmatically rather than by eye
- Works down to a 390 px phone

## Architecture

```
Browser (vanilla ES modules, no build step)
  │  SSE  ·  inline image/audio attachments
  ▼
FastAPI  ── routes: /api/chat · /api/chat/stream · /api/uploads · /api/sessions
  ▼
Coach (aura/coach.py) — orchestrates one turn:
  1. resolve attachments   → asr.py (Gemma native, Whisper fallback), vision.py
  2. screen for risk       → safety.py          ← runs BEFORE generation
  3. estimate affect       → affect.py          (text ⊕ prosody)
  4. build the prompt      → prompts.py + memory.py (topic graph, mood trend)
  5. generate              → engine/gemma.py | engine/echo.py
  6. synthesise speech     → tts.py             (best-effort; never blocks the reply)
  ▼
SessionStore — in-memory, TTL'd, LRU-bounded. Nothing touches disk.
```

Each module is independently testable and has no import-time dependency on
torch, which is why the suite runs in three seconds on a CPU.

## Engines

`AURA_ENGINE` selects the backend:

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `auto` *(default)* | Gemma 3n when `torch`/`transformers` are importable, otherwise `echo`. |
| `gemma` | Require Gemma 3n. Fails loudly if the ML stack is missing. |
| `echo` | The fallback engine, always. |

**The echo engine is not a stub.** It is a small reflective-listening coach built
from the same principles as the system prompt: mirror the speaker's own words,
name the feeling tentatively, ask one open question. It has no world knowledge —
only structure. It exists so that the UI, the API contract, CI and demos are
exercised for real on any machine, and so a GPU outage degrades the product
instead of ending it. Its output is deterministic per input.

---

## Evaluation

Full method, raw responses and known gaps: **[docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md)**.

The crisis screen is a pure function, so its numbers are independent of the
model. Measured against 33 cases labelled by intent — a third of them ordinary
language built from the same words the rules look for:

| | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Crisis precision | 85.7% | 100% |
| Crisis recall | 60.0% | 100% |
| Exact risk level | 63.3% | 100% |

"Before" is the screen as first written. It missed *"I self-harmed last night"*
(the rule matched only the bare stem, never an inflected form) and *"I have a
plan and I've written the note"* (no rule fires without the literal word
*suicide*) — while firing on *"I'm cutting myself some slack."* The suite and
the fixes were written together, so **100% means no *known* gaps, not no gaps**;
its real value is the baseline it exposed and the CI guard it now provides.

Coaching behaviour, 40 held-out prompts, six lexical proxies — on the echo
engine: 69.2% mean, `asks_question` 100%, `avoids_directives` 100%, but
`reflects` 7.5% and `hedges` 7.5%. Those last two are the gap a real model is
meant to close. **The Gemma 3n figure is not measured yet** — a full run is 40
generations and exceeds a free ZeroGPU account's daily quota.

---

## Safety

This is a wellness coach, not a clinician, and the code says so everywhere.

- The screen runs **before** generation. On a crisis match the model is never
  invoked, so no amount of prompting can route around it.
- It **fails toward escalation**, and softens `CRISIS` to `ELEVATED` when the
  language indicates a past or third-party account ("I used to…", "my friend
  said…") — so someone recounting their recovery isn't hit with an interrupt.
- Helplines are region-aware (`AURA_CRISIS_REGION`: `US`, `IN`, `UK`, `INTL`) and
  always include an international fallback.
- The crisis reply still **acknowledges the person** before it lists numbers.
- Conversations live in memory only, expire on a TTL, and are never written to
  disk or used for training. `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}` erases one immediately.

21 of the 119 tests cover this module alone, including false-positive cases
("I'm going to *kill* this presentation") and the softening rules.

## Training

The notebooks in `notebooks/` are preserved as the original exploration. The
pipeline they sketch is reimplemented, and debugged, in `src/aura/training/`.

```bash
pip install -e '.[train]'                       # GPU required
aura dataset --out artifacts/data --show 1      # inspect the pairs first
aura train --strategy dpo --max-steps 200
aura evaluate --engine gemma --adapter artifacts/wellness-coach/adapter
```

Then serve the adapter:

```bash
AURA_ADAPTER_PATH=artifacts/wellness-coach/adapter AURA_ENGINE=gemma aura serve
```

**Why DPO.** The thing being taught — reflective over directive, curious over
dismissive — is a *preference between two plausible replies*, not a single
correct string. Pairs are drawn from `jkhedri/psychology-dataset` (its own
preferred/dispreferred columns) and `drublackberry/hbr-coaching-real-leaders`
(real coach turns as `chosen`). SFT on the `chosen` side is available via
`--strategy sft` for environments where DPO's reference model doesn't fit.

<details>
<summary><strong>Three bugs in the original notebook, and their fixes</strong></summary>

1. **The datasets were concatenated with `+`**, which `datasets.Dataset` doesn't
   support — and the psychology set uses `question`/`response_j`/`response_k`,
   not `prompt`/`chosen`/`rejected`, so the validation pass would have discarded
   every row regardless. Now mapped explicitly, with a per-reason drop tally.
2. **The rejected coaching reply spliced in the user's own first word**
   (`f"You should just {client_text.lower().split()[0]} differently"`), which
   teaches the model that rejected replies begin with the user's words rather
   than that they are directive. Replaced with generic directive responses that
   carry no content from the prompt.
3. **Training failures were swallowed by a bare `except`** that silently fell
   through to a second trainer, so a misconfigured run looked like a successful
   one. The fallback is now explicit (`--fallback-to-sft`) and logs the
   traceback first.

Also added: deduplication, length filtering, a held-out eval split, and bf16/fp16
selected from the hardware rather than hard-coded to fp16.
</details>

### Evaluating behaviour, not just loss

A loss curve says nothing about whether a wellness coach got *better*.
`aura evaluate` scores held-out prompts on the qualities the fine-tune is meant
to instil — asks a question, avoids directives, reflects, hedges, stays brief,
avoids diagnosis — plus a **pass/fail safety check** that CI enforces on every
push.

```
Mean coaching score: 72.2%
Safety: PASS

Per-criterion pass rate:
  asks_question        100.0%  ████████████████████
  avoids_directives    100.0%  ████████████████████
  reflects              33.3%  ███████
  hedges                16.7%  ███
  concise              100.0%  ████████████████████
  avoids_diagnosis     100.0%  ████████████████████
```

These are lexical proxies for catching regressions between checkpoints, not
ground truth. Only the safety check is treated as pass/fail.

## API

Interactive docs at `/api/docs` once the server is running.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/chat` | One buffered turn |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/stream` | The same turn as SSE (`meta` → `token`* → `done`) |
| `POST` | `/api/uploads` | Stage an image or audio clip, returns an id |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/{id}` | Transcript plus derived insights |
| `DELETE` | `/api/sessions/{id}` | Erase a conversation |
| `GET` | `/api/resources` | Crisis resources for a region |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Engine state and live capability flags |

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"I have been feeling overwhelmed at work lately"}'
```

---

## Deploying

The app ships its UI inside the Python package, so any install serves the full
interface — no build step, no separate static host.

### Where the real thing runs

Gemma 3n needs an accelerator. Anywhere with a GPU works:

```bash
docker build --build-arg EXTRAS='[ml]' -t aura:gpu .
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 -e AURA_ENGINE=gemma aura:gpu
```

Hugging Face Spaces (GPU), Modal, Fly.io GPU machines, Cloud Run with GPU and a
plain GPU VM all take this image as-is. Mount a volume at
`/home/aura/.cache/huggingface` so weights survive restarts.

### The container

One image runs everywhere. It binds whatever port the platform hands it
(`PORT`, falling back to `AURA_PORT`, then 8000), runs as UID 1000 — the uid
Hugging Face Spaces uses — and carries a health check on `/api/health` that
never touches the engine, so a platform can probe it during model download.

```bash
docker build -t aura .
docker run -p 8000:8000 aura                 # local
docker run -e PORT=7860 -p 7860:7860 aura    # as a platform would
```

### Free hosting

**On a free Hugging Face account, ZeroGPU is the only hosting that runs real
Gemma 3n** — and it is Gradio-only, so a Docker Space cannot use it. That Space
is `deploy/spaces-gpu/`: a Gradio front end over the same coaching brain, with
only generation on the GPU.

```bash
hf repos create <user>/aura --type space --space-sdk gradio --flavor zero-a10g --public
deploy/spaces-gpu/push.sh <user>/aura
```

The crisis screen, affect estimate, topic graph and prompt assembly stay in the
Space's main process; `@spaces.GPU` wraps `model.generate` and nothing else. So
on a crisis match the model is never invoked — the guarantee is structural, not
a matter of instruction-following. Measured on the live Space: ~7 s for a
generated reply, ~0.9 s for a crisis reply.

The CPU-only options below run the echo engine instead. Note that Docker and
`cpu-basic` Spaces both require a paid HF plan; Render and Railway do not:

| | Ship it with | Free-tier catch |
|---|---|---|
| **Hugging Face Spaces** | `deploy/huggingface/push.sh <user>/<space>` | Sleeps after 48h idle; wakes on the next visit |
| **Render** | Blueprint → `deploy/render.yaml` | Spins down after ~15 min idle; cold start on the next request |
| **Railway** | Auto-detects the Dockerfile; set no port | Trial credits, not a permanent free tier |

Spaces needs a README with its own YAML front matter, which would be noise in
this one — so `deploy/huggingface/push.sh` assembles the Space from the tracked
files plus `deploy/huggingface/README.md` and pushes it:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
deploy/huggingface/push.sh your-name/aura     # → https://your-name-aura.hf.space
```

### Hosting the UI apart from the API

The server ships the UI, so the single-origin case needs no configuration. When
the front end lives somewhere else — a static host in front of a Space — point
it at the backend and let that origin through CORS:

```bash
# on the API
AURA_CORS_ORIGINS=https://aura.vercel.app
```

```html
<!-- in the page, before app.js loads -->
<meta name="aura-api-base" content="https://your-name-aura.hf.space" />
```

`?api=https://…` on the URL does the same thing per visit, which is handy for a
demo link. Same-origin remains the default when none of these is set.

### Vercel

Vercel deploys, and it is genuinely useful for showing the interface — but be
clear about what it can and cannot run:

```bash
vercel deploy      # entrypoint: api/index.py, config: vercel.json
```

**It runs the echo engine, not Gemma 3n.** A serverless bundle cannot hold
PyTorch and there is no GPU, so what you get is the reflective fallback coach
described under [Engines](#engines) — the real UI and API, with a much simpler
mind behind them. `vercel.json` pins `AURA_ENGINE=echo` so this is explicit
rather than a surprise at runtime.

Three further limits follow from serverless, and none of them are bugs:

| Limit | Effect |
|---|---|
| Instances are ephemeral and not shared | Sessions live in process memory, so conversation history, the topic graph and the mood trend survive only while an instance stays warm. Attachments are unaffected — the web client sends image and audio bytes inline with the turn (`attachments[]` on `POST /api/chat`) rather than staging them in a prior request, so nothing depends on two requests reaching the same instance. |
| No `ffmpeg` in the runtime | Browser voice notes arrive as WebM/Opus and cannot be decoded, so `AURA_ASR_BACKEND=none`. Plain WAV still decodes. |
| TTS needs torch | Spoken replies are off (`AURA_TTS_BACKEND=none`). |

If you want a Vercel deployment that holds a real conversation, the session
store is the thing to replace — `SessionStore` is deliberately narrow
(`get_or_create` / `get` / `delete` plus blob helpers) so a Redis or Vercel KV
implementation drops in behind it without touching any caller. That is the one
change standing between this and a stateless-friendly deployment.

---

## Development

```bash
make dev        # install with dev tooling
make test       # 148 tests, ~3s, no GPU or network
make lint       # ruff
make evaluate   # behavioural scoring
make serve      # hot reload
```

CI runs the suite on Python 3.10–3.12, lints, builds the Docker image and smoke
tests the running container.

### Configuration

Every setting is an `AURA_*` environment variable — see [`.env.example`](.env.example)
for the annotated list. The ones that matter most:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AURA_ENGINE` | `auto` | `auto` · `gemma` · `echo` |
| `AURA_MODEL_ID` | `unsloth/gemma-3n-E2B-it` | `E4B` for the larger variant |
| `AURA_ADAPTER_PATH` | — | LoRA adapter from `aura train` |
| `AURA_CRISIS_REGION` | `INTL` | `US` · `IN` · `UK` · `INTL` |
| `AURA_TTS_BACKEND` | `speecht5` | `speecht5` · `piper` · `none` |
| `AURA_ASR_BACKEND` | `gemma` | `gemma` · `whisper` · `none` |
| `AURA_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` | `21600` | 6 hours |

### Known limits

- Sessions are in-process, so the service is single-node as written. `SessionStore`
  is deliberately narrow (`get`/`create`/`delete`) so Redis can replace it.
- The affect lexicon is English-only. Gemma 3n itself is multilingual; the tone
  estimate is not.
- Prosody-based emotion is off by default — it needs an extra wav2vec2 model and
  adds noticeable latency.
- Browser audio arrives as WebM/Opus; decoding it needs `ffmpeg` on the host
  (included in the Docker image). Plain WAV works with no system dependencies.
